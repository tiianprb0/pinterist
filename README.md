# Pinterist

This project demonstrates a basic Pinterest-style layout built with just HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.

Open `index.html` in a browser to see sample pins loaded dynamically with infinite scrolling.
The layout now adapts to different screen sizes so you can test it on desktop or mobile widths.
